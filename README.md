# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we will need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. In this challenge, we use python to build several machine learning models, then evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk:

1. oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms;
2. undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm;
3. use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm;
4. compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.


## Results

### Oversample the data with RandomOverSampler


### Oversample the data with the SMOTE algorithm


### Undersample the data with the ClusterCentroids algorithm


### Over- and undersampling with the SMOTEENN algorithm


### BalancedRandomForestClassifier


### EasyEnsembleClassifier
